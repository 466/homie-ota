1. provide a dropdown list of available versions in the OTA update form (rather than free form text input)
3. add file size v device size validation
6. make it possible to swap a firmware on a device:
	it has 'blink-1.0.1'
	it should get 'relay-2.0.1'
	To do so, inventory needs to know what it should have, and provide a different binary
	even though device is requesting 'blink'
