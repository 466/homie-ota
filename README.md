# homie-ota

This is a small OTA (Over the Air) "server" for the excellent [Homie-ESP8266][Homie] framework for ESP8266 modules. In addition to providing OTA over HTTP/HTTPS, homie-ota also provides device inventory and firmware management with an explicitly retro-style Web interface (the KISS layout reminds us of the fact we're dealing with $4 IoT devices ...)

homie-ota contains a built-in HTTP server powered by [Bottle]; this is the bit that a Homie device talks to in order to obtain OTA firmware. On the other hand, homie-ota connects to your MQTT broker in order to obtain an inventory of Homie devices (current status (`$online`), firmware (`$fwname`) and firmware version (`$fwversion`), device name (`$name`), etc. These values are collected by homie-ota and stored in a JSON data structure in the file system.

## Features

* OTA firmware server for [Homie] devices.
* Upload new firmware to the firmware store.
* Trigger OTA firmware update by MQTT publish to a Homie device
* Logging

## Installation

Obtain homie-ota and its [requirements](requirements.txt). Copy the exmple configuration file to `homie-ota.ini` and adjust, creating the firmware directory if it doesn't yet exist.

Launch `homie-ota.py`.

Configure your [Homie] devices to actually use homie-ota by providing the appropriate settings in [their configuration](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266/blob/master/docs/5.-JSON-configuration-file.md):

## Preparing the firmware

In order to use the Autodetectable Binary Uploadâ„¢, your Homie sketch should contain a magic expression in it as shown [here](https://github.com/jpmens/homie-ota/issues/1). When you're ready, compile the binary to upload it.
Under the `Sketch` menu, select `Export compiled Binary`; the binary `.bin` will be placed in the sketch's directory.

The firmware file itself can be named however you wish, upon upload it is stored into the correct firmware directory and you are informed of where it's been placed:

```
Firmware from ed-relay.ino.d1_mini.bin uploaded as firmwares/dual-relay/dual-relay-1.0.2.bin
```
